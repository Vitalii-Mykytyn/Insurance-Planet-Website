      "My personal experience with insurance planet has been phenomenal. Marina Ivanchenkova helped me with homeowners insurance quotes and she has been amazing to work with. First, she is extremely efficient with her time with getting quotes. She provided me with two quotes and both were thousands cheaper than my existing insurance. I had reached out to my existing agent at the previous insurance agency and their quote and service didn't come anywhere near what I was provided by Marina. It is safe to say I'll be a customer here for a long time.",

      "Important info for future policy buyers with this company. Sharing my personal experience ‚Äî not to harm the company, but to help others know what they might face. I bought business insurance with a specific request. When a claim happened, I found out that the policy didn‚Äôt actually cover that request. My recommendation: when buying a policy from this company, review it thoroughly (you can even use ChatGPT) to make sure it covers what you need. Double-check your policy details ‚Äî don‚Äôt just take their word for it. I learned the hard way.",
