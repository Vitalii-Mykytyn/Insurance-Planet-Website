          ðŸ§­ Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed">
          To help you navigate lifeâ€™s uncertainties with confidence, clarity,
          and compassion.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We believe insurance should never feel cold or corporate. It should
          feel like someoneâ€™s truly got your back. Thatâ€™s why we blend the power
          of choice â€” working with multiple carriers to get you the best fit â€”
          with real human connection.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When you call us, you wonâ€™t get a robot or be tossed into a queue.
          Youâ€™ll get a person who listens, asks the right questions, and helps
          you make sense of your options without jargon or pressure. Whether
          you're insuring your first apartment or managing a fleet of commercial
          vehicles, weâ€™re here to make sure you understand your coverage â€” and
          feel good about it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our mission isn't just about policies. Itâ€™s about people. It's about
          being there when life happens â€” the good, the bad, and the
          unpredictable â€” and making sure you're covered through it all.
